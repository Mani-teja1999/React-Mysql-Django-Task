# React_Mysql_Django

This is code for User Details Application.
In this application we can perform CRUD operations on User data. 

It is built using django - backend, react - frontend and mysql - database.

Steps to run application:

1. Download Folder 'React_Mysql_Django'   

2. Install packages in requirements.txt (pip3 install -r requirements.txt)

Client side (Front-end):

3. Open frontend and then my_react_app and run 'npm start' (install packages if necessary)

Server side (Back-end):

4. Install mysql-client if not present and other packages if necessary.

5. Open backend and then my_proj and run 'python3 manage.py makemigrations'

6. Next, run 'python3 manage.py migrate'

7. Finally run 'python3 manage.py runserver' to run server.

Now, both client and server will be running on two different terminals.
You can start using application.
